**ReadHub** is a modern, cloud-based reading platform that allows readers to access their books from anywhere, on any device, with a sleek and fully customizable reading experience.

ReadHub is built to adapt to each reader’s preference—whether they prefer light or dark mode, side-slider (page-based) reading, or smooth vertical scrolling.
